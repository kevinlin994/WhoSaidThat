# WhoSaidThat
The goal of my project was to create a model that could determine the sex of a speaker using audio of them talking. Starting this project I had no prior experience with manipulating audio data or audio preprocessing workflow. While I looked at other projects in this space, I couldn't find examples of audio preprocessing pipelines working with human speech. I stumbled upon a Kaggle dataset that provided processed audio data, which pointed me towards what inputs I eventually would want to isolate, but it didnâ€™t explain how they were able to extract these features from speech audio. Figuring out how to create such inputs required much research into audio feature engineering: learning what information could feasibly be extracted from the audio, and understanding which of these features would help me accomplish my objective.

This repository contains notebooks that detail my audio-preprocessing and modelling work!
